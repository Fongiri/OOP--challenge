# 🐾 OOP Digital Pet Challenge

This project is a simple **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** challenge that simulates a digital pet. It is written in **Python** and demonstrates core OOP concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation.

## 🚀 Features

- Create a digital pet with a name and age.
- Interact with the pet through various actions:
  - `eat()` 🍽️ - Feeds the pet.
  - `play()` 🧸 - Plays with the pet.
  - `sleep()` 💤 - Puts the pet to sleep.
  - `train()` 🏋️ - Trains the pet to increase its intelligence.

Each interaction updates the pet's internal state (e.g., energy, hunger, happiness, intelligence).
