# 🐶 Python OOP Challenge: Build Your Own Digital Pet



In this challenge, we’ll be creating a virtual pet using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python. This fun project will help us practice how to use classes, attributes, methods, and constructors.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Create a class called `Pet` with the following:

### Attributes:
- `name`: the name of your pet
- `hunger`: an integer representing hunger level (0 = full, 10 = very hungry)
- `energy`: an integer representing energy level (0 = tired, 10 = fully rested)
- `happiness`: an integer (0–10)

### Methods:
- `eat()`: reduces hunger by 3 points (but not below 0), and increases happiness by 1.
- `sleep()`: increases energy by 5 points (but not above 10).
- `play()`: decreases energy by 2, increases happiness by 2, and increases hunger by 1.
- `get_status()`: prints the current state of the pet.

### Bonus 🎯
- Add a method `train(trick)` that teaches your pet a new trick and stores it in a list.
- Add a method `show_tricks()` that prints all learned tricks.

---

## 📝 How to Complete

1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Write your `Pet` class in `pet.py`.
3. In `main.py`, create a pet object and call its methods to test functionality.
4. Submit a GitHub repo or a zipped folder with your code and a screenshot of the output.

---

## ✅ Sample Output

```bash
Creating pet: Max
Max is eating...
Max is playing...
Max is sleeping...
Max's current status:
Hunger: 2
Energy: 8
Happiness: 9
Tricks: ['roll over', 'play dead']


### 💡 Tips
Use max() and min() to keep values between 0 and 10.

Think about edge cases like trying to play when energy is 0.

# 🐾 OOP Digital Pet Challenge

This project is a simple **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** challenge that simulates a digital pet. It is written in **Python** and demonstrates core OOP concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation.

## 🚀 Features

- Create a digital pet with a name and age.
- Interact with the pet through various actions:
  - `eat()` 🍽️ - Feeds the pet.
  - `play()` 🧸 - Plays with the pet.
  - `sleep()` 💤 - Puts the pet to sleep.
  - `train()` 🏋️ - Trains the pet to increase its intelligence.

Each interaction updates the pet's internal state (e.g., energy, hunger, happiness, intelligence).

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Classes and Objects
- Instance Attributes and Methods
- Encapsulation
- State Management

---

## 📁 Files

- `main.py` - Runs the program and handles user interaction.
- `pet.py` - Defines the `Pet` class and its methods.

---

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OOP-Challenge.git
   cd OOP-Challenge
